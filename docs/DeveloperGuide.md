### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/profplan/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/profplan/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/profplan/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/profplan/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Task` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/profplan/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

<br>
The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<br>
How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `ProfPlanParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a task).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ProfPlanParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `ProfPlanParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/profplan/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/UmlForModel.png" width="550" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the task list data i.e., all `Task` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueTaskList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Task` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `ProfPlan`, which `Task` references. This allows `ProfPlan` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Task` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>
<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/profplan/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both tasklist data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `ProfPlanStorage` and `UserPrefsStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `profplan.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


## DoNext feature
### Actual implementation
- The DoNext feature in ProfPlan allows users to generate a recommendation of which task to do next.
- We compute (priority) / (number of days to due date) for every task, and select the task with the highest computed value as the recommendation.
- This is because a task is recommended if it has higher priority and lower number of days left to due date.
- Below, we describe the implementation details for this feature through a (partial) UML class and state diagram:


[//]: # (<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin-bottom: 20px;">)

[//]: # (    <div style="flex: 1; margin-right: 5px;">)

The `DoNextCommand` is a part of the ProfPlan application, a task management tool. It allows users to generate next task recommendation. It is one of the standout features of ProfPlan, as it generates smart recommendations for professors.

### Code Structure
The code structure for the `DoNextCommand` is well-organized. It consists of the following components:
- `DoNextCommand` class: Represents the command itself.
- `ProfPlanParser` class: Responsible for parsing user input and creating `DoNextCommand` instances.
- `Priority` class: Represents the priority of a task (from 1 to 10).
- `DueDate` class: Represents the deadline of a task (in dd-MM-yyyy format, e.g. '01-02-2023').
- `Task` class: Represents a task, and it contains the priority and dueDate that `DoNextCommand` processes.
- `ModelManager` class: contains the `getDoNextTask()` function to generate recommended task.

## Mark/Unmark feature
### Actual implementation
The Mark/Unmark feature in ProfPlan allows users to set a task as done or undone respectively. Below, we describe the implementation details for this feature through a (partial) UML class diagram:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <div style="flex: 1; margin-right: 5px;">
        <img src="images/MarkCommandClassDiagram.png" alt="MarkCommand Class Diagram" width="380">

    <div style="flex: 1;">
        <img src="images/UnmarkCommandClassDiagram.png" alt="UnmarkCommand Class Diagram" width="380">
    </div>
</div>


The `MarkCommand` is a part of the ProfPlan application, a task management tool. The `MarkCommand` allows users to mark a task as done by specifying the task index. It is a critical part of the application's functionality, as it helps users manage and track their tasks efficiently.

    - `Task(Task task)`: Constructor for creating a new task as a copy of an existing task.

### Sequence Diagram <a name="sequence-diagram"></a>
The sequence diagram below provides an overview of how the `MarkCommand` is executed and interacts with other components.

![Sequence Diagram](images/MarkCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

Here's a breakdown of the sequence:
1. The `LogicManager` receives the command "mark 1" from the user.
2. The `ProfPlanParser` parses the command and recognizes it as a `MarkCommand`.
3. The `MarkCommandParser` parses the argument "1" and creates a `MarkCommand`.
4. The `MarkCommand` is executed.
5. The `Model` is updated by marking the task as done.
6. A `CommandResult` is created to provide feedback to the user.
7. The result is returned to the `LogicManager`.

### Usage <a name="usage"></a>
To use the `MarkCommand` in the ProfPlan application, you can execute the following steps:

1. Enter the "mark" command followed by the task index you want to mark as done. For example, "mark 1" marks the task with index 1 as done.

2. The `MarkCommand` will handle the task marking process and update the task status in the model.

3. The application will provide feedback, indicating the successful marking of the task as done.


## Filter feature
### Actual implementation
The Filter feature in ProfPlan allows users to filter according to one or more of the following criteria:
- `DueDate`: displays tasks before given due date
- `Priority`: displays tasks of given priority
- `Status`: displays tasks of given status
- `RecurringType`: displays tasks of given recurring type

Below, we describe the implementation details for this feature through a (partial )UML class diagram:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <div style="flex: 1; margin-right: 5px;">
        <img src="images/FilterCommandClassDiagram.png" alt="FilterCommand Class Diagram" width="800px">
    </div>
</div>


The `FilterCommand` is a part of the ProfPlan application, a task management tool. The `FilterCommand` allows users to filter tasks by due date, priority, and status. This enables clearer visualisation of tasks.

### Code Structure

### Usage <a name="usage"></a>
To use the `FilterCommand` in the ProfPlan application, you can execute the following steps:

1. Enter the "filter" command followed by "d/", "p/", "s/" and/or "recur/", for DueDate, Priority, Status and RecurringType respectively. Then, input the value of predicate, which must follow the formats of the criteria:
    - DueDate: a date in the format dd-MM-yyyy
    - Priority: an Integer from 1 to 10 inclusive
    - Status: "done" or "undone
    - RecurringType: "none", "daily", "weekly", "monthly", or "semesterly"
For example, "filter d/01-01-2023 s/undone" filters for tasks before and on 01-01-2023 that are undone.

2. The `FilterCommand` will filter the task list in the model according to the predicate(s) applied.

3. The application will provide feedback, indicating the successful filtering, and display the relevant tasks.


## Help for Commands feature

The detail listing mechanism is facilitated by the `HelpCommandParser` class, which implements the `Parser` interface. This `HelpCommandParser` overrides the `parse()` method in `Parser` and creates either an empty `HelpCommand`, or a `HelpCommand` with a `COMMAND_WORD` as a String. For example `help` or `help delete`.

Hence, this will be facilitated by overloading the constructor in `HelpCommand` to either create an empty `HelpCommand`, or a `HelpCommand` with a `COMMAND_WORD`:
* When an empty `HelpCommand` executes `execute()`, a `CommandResult` with `MESSAGE_USAGE` of all commands will be created.
* When a `HelpCommand` with a `COMMAND_WORD` executes `execute()`, a `CommandResult` with the `MESSAGE_DETAIL` of the `Command` specified by the `COMMAND_WORD` will be created.

The following activity diagram shows how the Help Command works:

![HelpActivityDiagram](images/HelpActivity.png)

### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to store `Command` details:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice): Store Command Details in each command.**

  * Pros: Follows OOP principles.

  * Cons: Changes will need to be propagated in Command Usage and Details format to all Commands individually.

* **Alternative 2: Store all Command Details in a separate class.**

  * Pros: Centralised area to view all Messages.

  * Cons: Does not follow OOP principles. Future implementations that tap on these Details will take longer to implement.


## Displaying statistics

The statistics mechanism requires support from `Model`, which will provide `StatsCommand` the required statistics. Currently, this is done using a public getter `getCompletionRate()`. 

When `StatsCommand` executes `execute()`, it calls this getter and returns a new `CommandResult` containing a formatted `String`, with the statistics retrieved.

The following sequence diagram shows how the stats command works:

![StatsSequenceDiagram](images/StatsSequenceDiagram.png)

Here's a breakdown of the sequence:
1. The `LogicManager` receives the command "stats" from the user.
1. The `ProfPlanParser` parses the command and creates a `StatsCommand`.
1. The `StatsCommand` is executed by `LogicManager`.
1. The getter, `getCompletionRate()`, is called on `Model`. 
1. `Model` returns a `double` containing the completion rate.
1. A `CommandResult` is created and formatted to provide feedback to the user.
1. The result is returned to the `LogicManager`.

### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to retrieve statistics:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice): Use a public getter in Model.**

  * Pros: Simple and readable.

  * Cons: Exposes more of Model, which may result in unintended use by developers.

* **Alternative 2: Retrieve a copy of the task list and calculate statistics as such.**

  * Pros: List is not mutated. All calculations of Statistics is centralised under StatsCommand.

  * Cons: Does not follow OOP principles. Operations regarding the list should be handled by the list.


## \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedProfPlan`. It extends `ProfPlan` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `profPlanStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedProfPlan#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current tasklist state in its history.
* `VersionedProfPlan#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous tasklist state from its history.
* `VersionedProfPlan#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone tasklist state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitProfPlan()`, `Model#undoProfPlan()` and `Model#redoProfPlan()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedProfPlan` will be initialized with the initial task list state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single task list state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th task in the tasklist. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitProfPlan()`, causing the modified state of the task list after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `profPlanStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted tasklist state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/Grade assignment â€¦â€‹` to add a new task. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitProfPlan()`, causing another modified tasklist state to be saved into the `ProfPlanStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitProfPlan()`, so the tasklist state will not be saved into the `profPlanStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the task was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoProfPlan()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous tasklist state, and restores the tasklist to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial ProfPlan state, then there are no previous ProfPlan states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoProfPlan()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoProfPlan()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the tasklist to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `profPlanStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest tasklist state, then there are no undone ProfPlan states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoProfPlan()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the tasklist, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitProfPlan()`, `Model#undoProfPlan()` or `Model#redoProfPlan()`. Thus, the `profPlanStateList` remains unchanged.

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitProfPlan()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `profPlanStateList`, all tasklist states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/Grade assignment â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire tasklist.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the task being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.



## \[Proposed\] Task Archiving feature

### Proposed Implementation

The proposed task archiving function makes use of the `ArchivedProfPlan` class. It extends `ProfPlan`, storing a separate list of tasks that are archived.

In addition, the `ModelManager`, which implements `Model`, has to include `ArchivedProfPlan`, in addition to `ProfPlan`, as one of its fields. 


#### 1. Archiving tasks

This is supported by the `ArchiveCommand` that extends `Command`, and implements this main operation:

* `ArchiveCommand#execute(Model model)`â€‰â€”â€‰Archives the selected task, i.e. deleting it from ProfPlan and adding it to ArchivedProfPlan.

This operation invodes a method in the `Model` interface, namely `Model#archiveTask(Task target)`.

To parse the Archive Command, there is the `ArchiveCommandParser` that implements `Parser`, which supports this main operation:

* `ArchiveCommandParser#parse(String args)` â€” Parses the user input to return an `ArchiveCommand`.
  * Valid arguments: Integers (task index), or "all"


The sequence diagram below shows how archiving a task works.

![ArchiveSequenceDiagram](images/ArchiveSequenceDiagram.png)


#### 2. List archived tasks

This is supported by the `ListArchivesCommand` that extends `Command`, and implements this main operation:

* `ListArchivesCommand#execute(Model model)`â€‰â€”â€‰Displays all archived tasks.

This operation invodes a method in the `Model` interface, namely `Model#getArchivedTasks()`. 


The sequence diagram below shows how displaying archived tasks works.

![ListArchivesSequenceDiagram](images/ListArchivesSequenceDiagram.png)


#### 3. Delete archived tasks

This uses similar implementation as the delete function on ProfPlan, but acting on ArchivedProfPlan instead.

It is supported by the `DeleteArchiveCommand` that extends `Command`, and implements this main operation:

* `DeleteArchiveCommand#execute(Model model)`â€‰â€”â€‰Deletes the selected task from ArchivedProfPlan.

This operation invodes a method in the `Model` interface, namely `Model#deleteArchive(Task target)`.

To parse the DeleteArchive Command, there is the `DeleteArchiveCommandParser` that implements `Parser`, which supports this main operation:

* `DeleteArchiveCommandParser#parse(String args)` â€” Parses the user input to return an `DeleteArchiveCommand`.
  * Valid arguments: Integers (task index), or "all"


#### 4. Restore archived tasks

This uses similar implementation as the archive function, but reversing ProfPlan and ArchivedProfPlan.

It is supported by the `RestoreArchiveCommand` that extends `Command`, and implements this main operation:

* `RestoreArchiveCommand#execute(Model model)`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the selected archived task, i.e. deleting it from ArchivedProfPlan and adding it to ProfPlan.

This operation invodes a method in the `Model` interface, namely `Model#restoreArchiveTask(Task target)`.

To parse the Archive Command, there is the `RestoreArchiveCommandParser` that implements `Parser`, which supports this main operation:

* `RestoreArchiveCommandParser#parse(String args)` â€” Parses the user input to return an `RestoreArchiveCommand`.
  * Valid arguments: Integers (task index), or "all"


### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to store archived tasks:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves archived tasks in a separate tasklist from the main ProfPlan, named ArchivedProfPlan.
  * Pros:
    * Better performance if many tasks are archived, and methods invoked on ProfPlan will not affect tasks in ArchivedProfPlan.
    * Clear segregation between archived and normal tasks.
  * Cons: Harder to implement.

* **Alternative 2:** Each task have an archive flag, which indicates whether they are archived. Archived tasks are not shown in the main ProfPlan.
  * Pros: Easier to implement as it is similar to tagging tasks.
  * Cons: Performance issues in the main ProfPlan if many tasks are archived.
